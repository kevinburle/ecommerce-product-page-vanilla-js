## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

Some extra features I added:

- Display one or more products dynamically
- Modify the products data by the data.js file
- Calculate the height of the cart dynamically according to the number of items
- Open the cart after adding a product
- Close the cart after a certain time after adding a product
- Application works the same way with one or more products
